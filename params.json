{"name":"Web Design","tagline":"The Iron Yard Austin — Jan 2015","body":"## PreWorkPlus\r\nAn extra set of PreWork Reading and Exercises for Web Design. The goals of PreWorkPlus that is it optional continued PreWork for when the main Prework is completed. There is no due date and the topics either build on the PreWork or include new topics.\r\n\r\n### PreWork and PreWorkPlus Office Hours\r\nFor the following two weeks before our class, Sam will be available during the following times to answer questions in person at [The Iron Yard](https://goo.gl/maps/l5i8m) about Prework or PreworkPlus assignments or chat one-on-one:\r\n* Monday through Thursday, 9am–12pm\r\n* Friday 10am–3pm\r\n\r\n### General Questions from Students\r\n1. _How long will it take to get used to these programs?_\r\nDesign and code is a lot like going to the gym: one day at the gym won't make a difference, so scheduling regular workouts will, so keep at it! Also, the first few days at the gym are the hardest. You're sore, tired, and not used to the routine yet. After that, it becomes easier, and easier to remember.\r\n\r\n2. _Do you recommend any tools that might come in handy for these two programs?_\r\nYou'll learn pretty quickly that a designer's workflow is made a lot easier and saves them a lot of time when they use keyboard shortcuts on their Macs. Most mac keyboard shortcuts are similar to their Windows counterpart with the use of Command (⌘) shortcut. To review common ones check out [this resource by Dan Rodney](http://www.danrodney.com/mac/). The most important for our uses will be New (⌘ + N), Save (⌘ + S), and Refresh (⌘ + R).\r\nI also think it's a great idea to invest in a cheap two-button mouse. I use the [Apple Magic Mouse](https://www.apple.com/magicmouse/) myself, but ANY mouse will work and it does not have to be an expensive one. It's also a good thing to know that you can adjust your mouse or trackpad settings to our own liking by clicking on the  symbol at the top left of your computer screen, selecting `System Preferences` and then `Mouse` or `Trackpad`. Another great tip: you can left-click on your mouse which having the Control (CTRL) button pushed to access a right-click option or menu.\r\nBoth Photoshop and Illustrator have keyboard shortcuts that will save you lots of time down the road. Both programs use single-button shortcuts to switch between tools. Here are some shortcut cheat-sheets:\r\n* [Photoshop single-key shortcuts](http://enfuzed.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Photoshop.jpg)\r\n* [Illustrator single-key shortcuts](http://enfuzed.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Illustrator.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Illustrator Assignments\r\n\r\n### Photoshop Assignments\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
